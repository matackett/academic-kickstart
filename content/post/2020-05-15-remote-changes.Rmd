<!--
To say this has been quite the semester would be an understatement. In the middle of my spring break, I got the notification that Duke was going to remote learning for the remainder of the semester. Though we were given an extra week to make the transition, it was still quite hectic to say the least. After a few weeks of getting used to the new format; however, I realized it wasnt' all bad. Though I still prefer teaching in-person classes, there were a few things I learned this semester that I want to keep doing in the future. 

That leads me to this post. This is my first blog post (well since my Xanga blog in high school), but I wanted to write it for a couple of reasons: 

1. to share my experience in the hopes that others learn from it. During that week and half of reorienting my class, I found hearing what other instructors found worked/didn't work online was incredibly valuable. Most (if not all) institutions have their summer classes online, and I imagine a lot of institutions will have some online component in the fall. 

2. Per #1, I want to remember my experience this semester, since I'm anticipating having to teach online again in the fall (this is just my hunch; Duke has not made any decision about the fall as the time I'm writing this post). 

[INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT THE TERM REMOTE LEARNING]
I'll use the term remote learning [IS THIS THE TERM?] to distinguish what I did this semester from traditional online classes that take a lot of time and careful thought to develop. 

I've decided to divide this into two parts: 

Part I: From In-Class to Remote
- [Preparation](#preparation)
- [From In-Person to Remote](#changes)

Part II: Lessons Learned (What I hope to keep / change in the fall)
- [What I want to continue doing](#went_well)
- [What I want to change](#to_change)
    
## Preparation
\label{preparation}

My course was "online-supported"[IS THIS THE RIGHT TERM? FIND LINK], i.e. almost every element of the course was already facilitated online. 

- Course website[ADD LINK] contained the syllabus, schedule, and links to lecture slides and assignments.
- The instructions to all assignments are on the course website. Students do their work in Rstudio and GitHub [ADD LINK TO DATA SCIENCE IN A BOX OR A PAPER], and submit it in Gradescope [ADD LINK].
- Students use RStudio using virtual machines maintained by the unviersity's Office of Information Technology. Therefore, they can always access RStudio through a web browser. Another option is using Rstudio Cloud [ADD LINK], a cloud-based platform provided and maintained by RStudio. 
- All assignments are graded in Gradescope, an online grading and rubric platform. Students see the feedback on the assignment and grade directly in Gradescope. Because Gradescope is connected to our LMS (Sakai), the grades are sent to the gradebook secured in  Sakai. 
- A PDF of the textbook was made available by Duke Library, so students could access it in the Sakai. 

Because students were already accessing most of what they needed in the course through a web browser, my primary focus during the transition was on the pedagogical elements, speficially how to do lectures and labs in the context of the new circumstances. This not only meant figuring out the technology but also figuring out how to connect and engage with students who were now around the world, in varying home circumstances.

One of the first things I did was create a survey to send to my students. The survey I sent was largely based on the survey designed by Dr. Kristen Stephens-Martinez  [ADD LINK]. The survey served two primary purposes: 

1. It helped me get in contact with the students. Since the course had 90 students, this was the most efficient way to try to get in contact with everyone. I set a deadline to fill out the survey and indvidually reached out to students who hadn't completed the survey by the deadline. 

2. It helped me better understand the circumstances students would be in as they finished the semester. Some of the most important pieces of information were the time zone and student's ability to engage in live lectures and labs. These were presented as mutliple choice questions with relatively generic answers about whether they were set up to participate through Zoom during the lecture and lab times (which were required to remain the same as the regular semester). I provided an option for students to elaborate on their answer. I also ended the survey with giving students the option to let me know any questions or concerns they had. 

    Sending the survey was by far the most valuable thing I did during the transtiion, as it helped me better understand the circumstances students were in. As I was planning for the course, having this informaiton helped me be more realistic about what the class would look like in the new remote format. 

In addition to the survey, I went to a lot of training courses held by Duke's Learning Innovation [ADD LINK] about transitioning to the remote format, and read almost anything I could find about teaching online courses. I also took a look at how successsful online programs, like Penn State's Program [ADD LINK] were run. 

While most trainings were more focused on how to use the technology, I did find value in just seeing how other people ran online workshops/courses, and how they utilized some of the different features in Zoom. One the most useful courses I took was by Greg Wilson's [ADD TITLE AND LINK]. I took his RStudio Instructor training online, so I knew he was a great facilitator of online courses, so I was happy to see he had a course for the moment. His course provided a nice bridge between the "how-to" of the technology to the pedagogical elements of teaching online. 

I gained enough ideas and strategies from these trainings, that I felt ~~ready~~ less terrified to teach online. 
 
## Changes 
\label{changes}
 
Here are a few of the key changes I made with the transition to remote learning. You can read about all of the changes and policy updates I made in the Remote Learning Updates [ADD LINK] page.
 
 **Lectures**: The biggest change to the semester was the way I conducted lectures. Since this was the main component of the class that relied on in-person interaction (lecture with active-learning activities sprinkled throughout), this was what needed the most attention as I made the transition to remote learning. I ultimately decided to split lectures into two components and create some version of a flipped classroom: 
 
  -Pre-recorded live lecture videos: These were essentially like the traditional lecture, where I recorded videos talking through the lecture slides. There were questions sprinkled throughout where in-class discussion/activites would've gone [LINK TO AN EXAMPLE], so I asked students to pause the video and jot down their thoughts/responses to the actvity questions. The pre-recorded lectures were posted about two days in advance in a discussion thread in Sakai, LMS. Students were told to either write their questions down to ask during the "Live Lecture Session" or to reply to the thread with their questions if they couldn't attend be live for the lecture. I checked the discussion thread before each class, so I could make sure to address the posted questions in the live lecture. 
  
- Live Lecture Session: This was time I met with the class on Zoom during the scheduled lecture time. I made an agenda for each live lecture [ ADD LINK], so students would know what to expect. I typically started with announcements and asking if there any questions that were posted in the discussion thread or that students posted in the Zoom chat or asked verbally after raising their hand. Some quesitons I answered right away; others I jotted down to come back to later since I knew there'd be a more natural place to answer them. 

    After taking questions,  we basically went through the remaining time walking through an analysis covering the topic. Students could use an Rmd file or rendered HTML to follow-along. I usually talked about the code and more practical elements, since students got the basic terminology and definitions from the pre-recorded lecture. During most live lectures, I randomly split students into breakout rooms to talk about the discussion questions from the videos. 
  
    I popped into a few break out rooms during the discussions (students were told beforehand this would happen), and it was really great. A lot of students had their video on in the breakout rooms and it just made everything feel more energetic than in the larger setting. Even as students came back to the main room, a few would keep their video on. I randomly selected a breakout room to respond to the class. 
  
    The live lecture sessions were recorded and uploaded into the LMS, so students who were unable to attend live could still access the content. 

- Final project: Students had just begun their final group project [ADD LINK] before the transition, so I gave them the option to continue with the same project in their same groups or do something else. They overwhelmingly decided to stay in their same groups (I think because they had been with these groups since the 3rd week of the semester and had learned to work together). The project stayed largely the same, with the exception of the final presentation. Rather than present in-class, each group recorded a video presentation and uploaded it in a discussion thread in Sakai. I gave groups the option to upload their slides with a written transcript if video wasn't an viable option. Students were randomly assigned three presentations to write and post comments. I'll talk about this more in [SECTION NAME - THINGS TO KEEP WITH LINK], but in summary I really liked this format! 

- Midterm 2: I give two in-class paper midterms during the semester where students are allowed to bring one page of handwritten notes. Given the exams would be done remotely, I opted for an open-note, open-book exam. I tried to keep the format as similar to the first exam as possible, so students typed their responses in a Word document of the exam, saved it as a PDF and uploaded their resposes to the LMS. The exam was written to be taken within 75 minutes, but students had 2 hours to take the exam to provide flexibility for any computing issues.

In Part 2, I'll talk about some of the things that worked and that I plan to continue doing in the fall and other things I want to change.
