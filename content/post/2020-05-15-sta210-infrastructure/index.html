summary: This is the first in a three-part series about teaching an undergraduate regression course in Spring 2020. In this post, I describe the infrastructure for the course, which was primarily web-based even before the transition to remote learning.

<ul>
<li>Set about writing a blog post about going from f2f to remote</li>
<li>Realized I had a lot to write, so my one post turned into 3.</li>
<li>I’m writing these posts for 2 reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I find it helpful to exchange ideas, especially in times like this when a lot of instructors are learning a new way to teach, learning it super quickly, and will be expected to do it well.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems inevitable that I will have to teach online again, if not in the fall (Duke hasn’t made an official announcement yet) then at some point in my career. Therefore it seems useful to write down and reflect on my experience this spring.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The posts will be in three parts:</p>
<p>👩🏾‍🏫 Course before the transition</p>
<p>👩🏾‍💻 What changed in remote learning</p>
<p>🕵🏾‍♀️ Figuring what worked and didn’t work</p>
<!--
[INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT THE TERM REMOTE LEARNING]
I'll use the term remote learning [IS THIS THE TERM?] to distinguish what I did this semester from traditional online classes that take a lot of time and careful thought to develop.

<h2>The Course: Regression Analysis</h2>
<p>Before I talk about the infrastructure, here is a brief description of the course to give you some context:</p>
<p>Regression Analysis is a second-semester undergraduate course focused on analyzing multivariate data using regression models. Because the course is early in the undergraduate curriculum, the primary focus is on application rather than the mathematical theory. A more detailed description of the course is at the top of the <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/index.html">course webpage</a>.</p>
<p>There were 90 students in the course in Spring 2020, covering all years - freshmen to senior. The course is designed to include a lecture 2X a week and a lab with 30 students in each lab section.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insert a sketch of the course infrastructure.</li>
<li>Overall design based on data science in a box.
My course was already “technology-supported” (also known as digitally-enhanced) [ADD LINK AND FORMAL DEFINTION]. In other words, almost every element of the course as facilitated online, all being anchored by the in-person lecture and labs. To give you can idea of what a technology-enhanced course looks like, here is a description of how students interact what they need for the course:</li>
</ul>
<div id="materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/index.html"><strong>Course website</strong></a>: Everything needed for the course is accessible from the website. This includes all course content along with links to Sakai, GitHub, and RStudio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sakai</strong>: This is Duke’s Learning Managment System (LMS). It is the place for all protected content such as grades. A link to Sakai is available on the course website.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sta210-sp20/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>: All homework, lab assignments, and the final group project are done using GitHub and RStudio. A private repo is created for each student (or group) that contains an R Markdown template, the data, and a link to the assignment instructions. Students push their updates to the repo as they complete the assignment. I won’t go into more detail here, but you can read [INSERT PAPER] to see examples of using GitHub in a variety of statistics courses.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="rstudio.com"><strong>RStudio</strong></a>: Students use RStudio maintained by the unviersity’s Office of Information Technology, so they can access RStudio through a web browser. <a href="rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a> is a cloud-based platform provided and maintained by RStudio that is another great served-based option if your institution doesn’t have RStudio servers. In addition to the benefits discussed in [INSERT MINE and COLIN’s PAPER], using a server-based computing platform made the transition to remote teaching smoother (more on that later).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/"><strong>Gradescope</strong></a>: Students submit their assignments on Gradescope, an online grading and rubric platform. Students can see their assignment grade, the grading rubric, and comments on Gradescope; it is synced with Sakai, so the assignment grade also gets posted in the gradedbook in Sakai.</p></li>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="piazza.com"><strong>Piazza</strong></a>: Online forum for asking questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since so much of the course was already operating online, my primary focus during the transition was figuring out how to move the face-to-face interactions from the classroom to a video conference. In other words, how to do lectures, labs, office hours, and the final group project on Zoom. This meant not only figuring out how to use all the features in Zoom but also how to engage students synchronously and asychronously.</p>
