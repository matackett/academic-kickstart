<p>This is a blog post about going from face-to-face (f2f) to remote learning.</p>
<p>To say this has been quite the semester would be an understatement. In the middle of my spring break, I got the notification that Duke was going to remote learning for the remainder of the semester. Though we were given an extra week to make the transition, it was still quite hectic to say the least. After a few weeks of getting used to the new format; however, I realized it wasnt‚Äô all bad. Though I still prefer teaching in-person classes, there were a few things I learned this semester that I want to keep doing in the future.</p>
<p>That leads me to this post. This is my first blog post (well since my Xanga blog in high school), but I wanted to write it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>to share my experience in the hopes that others learn from it. During that week and half of reorienting my class, I found hearing what other instructors found worked/didn‚Äôt work online was incredibly valuable. Most (if not all) institutions have their summer classes online, and I imagine a lot of institutions will have some online component in the fall.</p></li>
<li><p>Per #1, I want to remember my experience this semester, since I‚Äôm anticipating having to teach online again in the fall (this is just my hunch; Duke has not made any decision about the fall as the time I‚Äôm writing this post).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>[INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT THE TERM REMOTE LEARNING]
I‚Äôll use the term remote learning [IS THIS THE TERM?] to distinguish what I did this semester from traditional online classes that take a lot of time and careful thought to develop.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve decided to divide this into two parts:</p>
<p>‚û°Ô∏è Part 1: From F2F to Remote</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sta210">The course: Regression Analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="#preparation">Preparing for remote learning</a></li>
<li><a href="#changes">How the course changed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>üí° Part 2: Lessons Learned (What I hope to keep / change in the fall)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#went_well">What I want to continue doing</a> - Fix link</li>
<li><a href="#to_change">What I want to change</a> - Fix link</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Course: Regression Analysis</h2>
<p>[INSERT A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE CLASS - CLASS SIZE AND WHO‚ÄôS IN IT, WHAT IS COVERED, LABS AND LECTURES].</p>
<p>My course was already ‚Äútechnology-ehanced‚Äù (also known as digitally-enhanced) [ADD LINK AND FORMAL DEFINTION]. In other words, almost every element of the course as facilitated online, all being anchored by the in-person lecture and labs. To give you can idea of what a technology-enhanced course looks like, here is a description of how students interact what they need for the course:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/index.html"><strong>Course website</strong></a>: Everything needed for the course is accessible from the website. This includes all course content along with links to Sakai, GitHub, and RStudio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sakai</strong>: This is Duke‚Äôs Learning Managment System (LMS). It is the place for all protected content such as grades. A link to Sakai is available on the course website.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sta210-sp20/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>: All homework, lab assignments, and the final group project are done using GitHub and RStudio. A private repo is created for each student (or group) that contains an R Markdown template, the data, and a link to the assignment instructions. Students push their updates to the repo as they complete the assignment. I won‚Äôt go into more detail here, but you can read [INSERT PAPER] to see examples of using GitHub in a variety of statistics courses.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="rstudio.com"><strong>RStudio</strong></a>: Students use RStudio maintained by the unviersity‚Äôs Office of Information Technology, so they can access RStudio through a web browser. <a href="rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a> is a cloud-based platform provided and maintained by RStudio that is another great served-based option if your institution doesn‚Äôt have RStudio servers. In addition to the benefits discussed in [INSERT MINE and COLIN‚Äôs PAPER], using a server-based computing platform made the transition to remote teaching smoother (more on that later).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/"><strong>Gradescope</strong></a>: Students submit their assignments on Gradescope, an online grading and rubric platform. Students can see their assignment grade, the grading rubric, and comments on Gradescope; it is synced with Sakai, so the assignment grade also gets posted in the gradedbook in Sakai.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="piazza.com"><strong>Piazza</strong></a>: Online forum for asking questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since so much of the course was already operating online, my primary focus during the transition was figuring out how to move the face-to-face interactions from the classroom to a video conference. In other words, how to do lectures, labs, office hours, and the final group project on Zoom. This meant not only figuring out how to use all the features in Zoom but also how to engage students synchronously and asychronously.</p>
