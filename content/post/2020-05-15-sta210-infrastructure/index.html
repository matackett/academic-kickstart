summary: This is the first in a two-part series about teaching an undergraduate regression course in Spring 2020. In this post, I describe the infrastructure for the course, which was primarily web-based even before the transition to remote learning.

<p>Spring 2020 was quite the semester (to say the least), so I thought it’d be worth writing about the experience of going from face-to-face (f2f) to “emergency remote” teaching. There’s a lot of info to share, so I’ll split it into two posts:</p>
<p>👩🏾‍🏫 Part 1: The infrastructure for an undergraduate regression course</p>
<p>👩🏾‍💻 Part 2: How the class changed in the transition to remote, including what worked and didn’t work.</p>
<div id="sta210" class="section level2">
<h2>The Course: Regression Analysis</h2>
<p>Before I talk about the infrastructure, here is a brief description of the course to give you some context:</p>
<p>Regression Analysis is a second-semester undergraduate course focused on analyzing multivariate data using regression models. Because the course is early in the undergraduate curriculum, the primary focus is on application rather than the mathematical theory. A more detailed description of the course is at the top of the <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/index.html">course website</a>.</p>
<p>There were 90 students in the course in Spring 2020, covering all years - freshmen to senior. The course is designed to include a lecture 2X a week and a lab with 30 students in each lab section.</p>
</div>
<div id="infrastructure" class="section level2">
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>[Insert a sketch of the course infrastructure]</li>
</ul>
<p>The course can be described as “technology supported”, i.e. most of the course is facilitated online and is anchored by in-person lectures and labs. The infrastructure is based on the one described in <a href="https://datasciencebox.org/infrastructure/">Data Science in a Box</a>. I’ll describe each part of the infrastructure below.</p>
<div id="materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><font class = "emph">Course website</font>: The <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/index.html">course website</a> is the central hub for the course. Students can access anything they need including the syllabus, course schedule, lecture slides, and assignment instructions from the website. It also includes links to the other platforms we use (e.g. Sakai, GitHub). I encourage students to bookmark the course website, since it is the one-stop shop for everything they need in the course.</p></li>
<li><p><font class = "emph">Learning Management System (LMS)</font>: All protected content, such as grades, are put in the LMS. It also includes links to the course schedule, syllabus, and the platforms listed below, in case students would rather navigate the course through the LMS rather than the website.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><font class = "emph">GitHub</font>: All homework, lab assignments, and the final group project are done using GitHub and RStudio. An <a href="http://www.github.com/sta210-sp20">“organization”</a> is created for the course on GitHub and is connected to GitHub Classroom so students’ work can remain private. For each assignment, a private <strong>repo</strong>sitory, i.e. directory, is created for each student or group. I use the <a href="https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/">ghclass R package</a> to make the student repos based on a single starter repo that contains an R Markdown template, the data, and a link to the assignment instructions. Students connect their private repo to a project in RStudio and “push” their updates to the repo as they complete the assignment. I won’t go into more detail here, but here are some good resources for using GitHub in your course:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/design-ds-classroom/materials/05-github/slides/05-github.html#1"><em>Reproducible Workflows: R Markdown, Git, GitHub</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01988"><em>Implementing version control with Git as a learning objective in statistics courses</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2019.1617089#.XtbPQBNKgdU"><em>Using GitHub Classroom To Teach Statistics</em></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><font class = "emph">RStudio</font>: Students use RStudio through a server maintained by the university’s Office of Information Technology. They access RStudio through a web browser, so they can use it on almost any device, including tablets and notebooks. <a href="rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a> is a cloud-based platform provided and maintained by RStudio that is another great served-based option if your institution doesn’t have RStudio servers. The article <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/"><em>Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum</em></a> discusses the details and benefits of using RStudio through servers for teaching.</p></li>
<li><p><font class = "emph">Gradescope</font>: Students submit their assignments on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>, an online grading and rubric platform. Students can see their assignment grades, grading rubrics, and comments on Gradescope. It can sync with numerous LMS platforms, so the grades can easily be posted in the gradebook in the LMS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To get an idea of how I use RStudio, GitHub, and Gradescope in a typical assignment, check out the slides from my Women in Statistics and Data Science talk <a href="https://github.com/matackett/talks/blob/master/presentations/wsds-2019.pdf"><em>Using GitHub and RStudio to facilitate authentic learning experiences in a regression analysis course</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level3">
<h3>Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><font class = "emph">Student Q&amp;A</font>: Students use <a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>, an online Q&amp;A platform to post questions about assignments and the course content. Anyone in the course can respond to the question, so this gives students an opportunity to answer each others’ questions. It also keeps me and the teaching assistants from having to answer the same question multiple times.</p></li>
<li><p><font class = "emph">Teaching Team Communication</font>: I use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> to communicate with the teaching team. We have multiple channels - <em>general, hw, labs, exams, project, office-hours</em> - to help organize the conversation. Aside from an initial email at the beginning of the semester, all communication with the teaching team occurs in Slack. This helps keep everything in one place, and the more relaxed nature of Slack (compared to email) encourages more frequent discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Part 2, I’ll share how the course changed when we transitioned to remote learning. <em>Spoiler alert: having this course infrastructure made the transiton much smoother.</em></p>
