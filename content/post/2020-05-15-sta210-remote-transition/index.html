<p>Introduction</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1, I talked about the online-supported infrastructure for the class.</li>
<li>In this part I discuss the transition to remote learning and what worked / didn‚Äôt work.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm teaching remotely in the fall, so I my goal is to start with what I did in the spring and improve upon it for the fall.</li>

<h2>Preparing for remote learning</h2>
<div id="student-survey" class="section level3">
<h3>Student Survey</h3>
<p>One of the first things I did in the transition was make a survey for my students adapted from the <a href="https://twitter.com/ksm_csed/status/1238117765829079041">COVID-19 Student Survey</a> created by Dr.¬†Kristen Stephens-Martinez. Sending the survey was the most helpful thing I did during the transition to remote learning for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>It helped me get in contact with the students.</strong> This was the most efficient way to try to get in contact with the students, given they were now living all over the world. I asked the students to complete the survey within a week; after the deadline, I reached out individually to students who hadn‚Äôt returned the survey. By that point, I was able to get in contact with every student in the class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It helped me better understand each student‚Äôs new learning environment.</strong> The primary pieces of information I asked for were the student‚Äôs</p>
<ul>
<li>time zone</li>
<li>presumed availability during lecture and lab times</li>
<li>access to reliable internet</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also an optional part of the survey for students to share any questions or concerns they had about the transition to remote learning. This helped me better understand some of the other challenges some students would face aside from time zone and internet issues. It also helped me better understand some of the general concerns students had, so I was able to better address those as I planned for the rest of the semester.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Like a lot of instructors, I had never taught online, so I went to <em>a lot</em> training workshops and read almost anything I could find about teaching remotely. Here are just a few of the resources I used to learn more about teaching remotely.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/teaching-online-on-short-notice/">Webinar: Teaching online on short notice</a> by Greg Wilson</li>
<li><a href="https://keepteaching.duke.edu/workshops/">Keep Teaching Workshops by Duke Learning Innovation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/resources-for-teaching-data-science-and-statistics-remotely/">Resources and tips for teaching (with) R remotely</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Penn State has an established <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/statprogram/">online statistics program</a>, so I also used their courses as I adapted my class to the new remote format.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="changes" class="section level2">
<h2>What changed</h2>
<p>Using these resources gave me enough ideas and strategies that I felt <del>completely ready</del> less terrified to teach remotely.</p>
<p>Since a lot of the course infrastructure was already online, I focused my efforts on adapting the f2f components - lectures, labs, exams, and final presentations. I also made changes to the course policies, the most substantial being around late work, to give students more flexibility but still help them keep up with the course material. The changes to course policies are in the <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/covid-19-updates.html">Remote Learning Updates</a>.</p>
<div id="lectures" class="section level3">
<h3>Lectures</h3>
<p>As with a lot of classes, the biggest change I made in the transition to remote learning is how I did lectures. The biggest change to the semester was the way I conducted lectures. In the f2f class, I did active lectures with small group activities and polling questions throughout. As I thought about reorienting the lectures for Zoom, I tried to balance the desire to</p>
<p>‚úÖ continue meeting for synchronously for lecture.</p>
<p>‚úÖ not disadvantage students who couldn‚Äôt attend the synchronous lecture.</p>
<p>‚úÖ make the synchronous lectures interactive (or at least as interactive as 90 people on Zoom can be).</p>
<p>Taking these considerations into account, I landed on using a flipped classrom where students watched <em>lecture content videos</em> and we answered questions and worked on examples during the <em>live lecture session</em>. I used this language (instead of ‚Äúasychronous‚Äù vs.¬†‚Äúsynchronous‚Äù), to help students more easily keep track of the new format.</p>
</div>
<div id="lecture-content-videos-asynchronous" class="section level3">
<h3>Lecture content videos (asynchronous)</h3>
<p>Before each ‚Äúlive‚Äù lecture, students watched pre-recorded videos covering the content. In these videos, I talked through the lecture slides and included periodic quesitions to mimic the short activities I typically did in f2f lectures. In the videos, I asked students to ‚ÄúPause the video, write down your response to the quesitons, and we‚Äôll discuss them during the live lecture session.‚Äù I also told students to write down any questions they had about the content in the videos, and we would discuss them in the live lecture session.</p>
<p>The pre-recorded lectures were posted about two days in advance in a discussion forum in Sakai. I used the discussion forum, so students had the opportunity to post any questions directly under the video. This was most important for students unable to attend the live lecture session, so they could still get answers to their questions. This also provided an opportunity for students to remain engaged Students were told to either write their questions down to ask during the ‚ÄúLive Lecture Session‚Äù or to reply to the thread with their questions if they couldn‚Äôt attend be live for the lecture. I checked the discussion thread before each class, so I could make sure to address the posted questions in the live lecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="live-lecture-session-synchronous" class="section level3">
<h3>Live lecture session (synchronous)</h3>
<p>Zoom during the scheduled lecture time. I made an agenda for each live lecture [ ADD LINK], so students would know what to expect. I typically started with announcements and asking if there any questions that were posted in the discussion thread or that students posted in the Zoom chat or asked verbally after raising their hand. Some quesitons I answered right away; others I jotted down to come back to later since I knew there‚Äôd be a more natural place to answer them.</p>
<pre><code>After taking questions,  we basically went through the remaining time walking through an analysis covering the topic. Students could use an Rmd file or rendered HTML to follow-along. I usually talked about the code and more practical elements, since students got the basic terminology and definitions from the pre-recorded lecture. During most live lectures, I randomly split students into breakout rooms to talk about the discussion questions from the videos. 

I popped into a few break out rooms during the discussions (students were told beforehand this would happen), and it was really great. A lot of students had their video on in the breakout rooms and it just made everything feel more energetic than in the larger setting. Even as students came back to the main room, a few would keep their video on. I randomly selected a breakout room to respond to the class. 

Used an iPad with the pencil [WHAT&quot;S THIS CALLED?] and the Goodnotes app as the white board. This worked better for me than Zoom white board, since I often needed to write equations. I also used it write Welcome and point students to the day&#39;s notes as they entered the class. I typically started the Zoom live lecture session about 5 minutes early. 

The live lecture sessions were recorded and uploaded into the LMS, so students who were unable to attend live could still access the content.

<h3>Labs</h3>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level3">
<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 2: I give two in-class paper midterms during the semester where students are allowed to bring one page of handwritten notes. Given the exams would be done remotely, I opted for an open-note, open-book exam. I tried to keep the format as similar to the first exam as possible, so students typed their responses in a Word document of the exam, saved it as a PDF and uploaded their resposes to the LMS. The exam was written to be taken within 75 minutes, but students had 2 hours to take the exam to provide flexibility for any computing issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="video-presentations" class="section level3">
<h3>Video presentations</h3>
<p>Students had just begun their final group project [ADD LINK] before the transition, so I gave them the option to continue with the same project in their same groups or do something else. They overwhelmingly decided to stay in their same groups (I think because they had been with these groups since the 3rd week of the semester and had learned to work together). The project stayed largely the same, with the exception of the final presentation. Rather than present in-class, each group recorded a video presentation and uploaded it in a discussion thread in Sakai. I gave groups the option to upload their slides with a written transcript if video wasn‚Äôt an viable option. Students were randomly assigned three presentations to write and post comments. I‚Äôll talk about this more in [SECTION NAME - THINGS TO KEEP WITH LINK], but in summary I really liked this format!</p>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<div id="what-worked" class="section level3">
<h3>What worked</h3>
<pre><code>- Gave survey to students [link to survey questions - google doc] to learn more about their learning circumstance. Survey inspired by a colleague who gave a similar one.
- Flipped classroom. Have always wanted to do this but have never had the guts / time. Now I was forced to record videos and figure it out.
- Ancedotal evidence from students that they liked this format.
- Video presentations for the final project &amp; discussion board. Rich conversation and enjoyed the creativity.</code></pre>

<h3>What needs to go back to the drawing board</h3>
<ul>
<li>What I need to figure out for the fall
<ul>
<li>How to engage a large class on Zoom. Even with about 1/3 to half of my class being live, it is still difficult to engage that many students on Zoom. [Link to learning innovation‚Äôs site on active learning]. Help foster more connection between students in the class, since they miss the time before and after class where they can causally talk with one another.</li>
<li>Give students a topic (doesn‚Äôt have to be related to the content) and give them 5 minutes at the beginning of class to discuss it with each other in break out rooms. The instructor doesn‚Äôt go in any of these rooms, so students can share freely with one another.</li>
<li>Help students manage teamwork remotely</li>
<li>Quality of videos on Zoom. Man they were bad. Need editing, and maybe a better way to ensure student‚Äôs engage.</li>
<li>Office hours, waiting room. Use a tool like MyDigital Hand.</li>
