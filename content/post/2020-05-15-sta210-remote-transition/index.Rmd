Introduction 

- Part 1, I talked about the online-supported infrastructure for the class.
- In this part I discuss the transition to remote learning and what worked / didn't work. 
- I'm teaching remotely in the fall, so I my goal is to start with what I did in the spring and improve upon it for the fall. 

## Preparing for remote learning {#preparation}

### Student Survey

One of the first things I did in the transition was make a survey for my students adapted from the [COVID-19 Student Survey](https://twitter.com/ksm_csed/status/1238117765829079041) created by Dr. Kristen Stephens-Martinez. Sending the survey was the most helpful thing I did during the transition for two reasons:

1. **It helped me get in contact with the students.** This was the most efficient way to try to get in contact with the students, given they were now living all over the world. I gave students about a week to do the survey and reached out individually to those who hadn't completed it by the deadline. By that point, I was able to get in contact with every student in the class.
2. **It helped me better understand the circumstances students would be in as they finished the semester.** The main pieces of information for planning purposes were the students'

    `r emo::ji("one")` time zones

    `r emo::ji("two")` presumed availablity during lecture and lab times

    `r emo::ji("three")` access to reliable internet

    There was also space for students to share any questions or concerns they had about the transition to remote learning. These comments gave perspective about the new realities a lot of students faced and just the general concern about what would happen the rest of the semester.

### Training

Like a lot of instructors, I had never taught online, so I went to *a lot* training workshops and read almost anything I could find about teaching online classes. Here are some of the resources I used to learn more about teaching online:

- [Webinar: Teaching online on short notice](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/teaching-online-on-short-notice/) by Greg Wilson
- [Workshops by Duke Learning Innovation](https://keepteaching.duke.edu/workshops/)
- [Resources and tips for teaching (with) R remotely](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/resources-for-teaching-data-science-and-statistics-remotely/)
- [Penn State STAT Online Program](https://online.stat.psu.edu/statprogram/)
- [Webinar: Teaching R online with RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/teaching-r-online-with-rstudio-cloud/) by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel
- [Webinar: Sharing on Short Notice: How to get your materials online with R Markdown](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/) by Alison Hill and Desiree De Leon.

<!--
While most trainings were more focused on how to use the technology, I did find value in just seeing how other people ran online workshops/courses, and how they utilized some of the different features in Zoom. One the most useful courses I took was by Greg Wilson's [ADD TITLE AND LINK]. I took his RStudio Instructor training online, so I knew he was a great facilitator of online courses, so I was happy to see he had a course for the moment. His course provided a nice bridge between the "how-to" of the technology to the pedagogical elements of teaching online.

Using these resources gave me enough ideas and strategies that I felt completely ready less terrified to teach remotely.

## f2f to remote {#changes}

Here I'll focus on the major changes I made to adapt some of the f2f components of the course to the new remote environment. I'll just describe the changes here, and in Part 2, I'll discuss what worked and what I'd do differently if/when I teach remotely again. I also made changes to the course policies, the biggest change being around late work, to give students more flexibilty while still maintaining the general courese structure. The changes in course policies are in the [Remote Learning Updates](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/covid-19-updates.html).

### Lectures

As with a lot of classes, the biggest change I made in the transition to remote learning is how I did lectures. The biggest change to the semester was the way I conducted lectures. In the f2f class, I did active lectures with small group activities and polling questions throughout. As I thought about reorienting the lectures for Zoom, I tried to balance the desire to

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` continue meeting for synchronously for lecture.

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` not disadvantage students who couldn't attend the synchronous lecture.

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` make the synchronous lectures interactive (or at least as interactive as 90 people on Zoom can be).

Taking these considerations into account, I landed on using a flipped classrom where students watched *lecture content videos* and we answered questions and worked on examples during the *live lecture session*. I used this language (instead of "asychronous" vs. "synchronous"), to help students more easily keep track of the new format.

### Lecture content videos (asynchronous)

Before each "live" lecture, students watched pre-recorded videos covering the content. In these videos, I talked through the lecture slides and included periodic quesitions to mimic the short activities I typically did in f2f lectures. In the videos, I asked students to "Pause the video, write down your response to the quesitons, and we'll discuss them during the live lecture session." I also told students to write down any questions they had about the content in the videos, and we would discuss them in the live lecture session.

The pre-recorded lectures were posted about two days in advance in a discussion forum in Sakai. I used the discussion forum, so students had the opportunity to post any questions directly under the video. This was most important for students unable to attend the live lecture session, so they could still get answers to their questions. This also provided an opportunity for students to remain engaged Students were told to either write their questions down to ask during the "Live Lecture Session" or to reply to the thread with their questions if they couldn't attend be live for the lecture. I checked the discussion thread before each class, so I could make sure to address the posted questions in the live lecture.

### Live lecture session (synchronous)

Zoom during the scheduled lecture time. I made an agenda for each live lecture [ ADD LINK], so students would know what to expect. I typically started with announcements and asking if there any questions that were posted in the discussion thread or that students posted in the Zoom chat or asked verbally after raising their hand. Some quesitons I answered right away; others I jotted down to come back to later since I knew there'd be a more natural place to answer them.

```
After taking questions,  we basically went through the remaining time walking through an analysis covering the topic. Students could use an Rmd file or rendered HTML to follow-along. I usually talked about the code and more practical elements, since students got the basic terminology and definitions from the pre-recorded lecture. During most live lectures, I randomly split students into breakout rooms to talk about the discussion questions from the videos. 

I popped into a few break out rooms during the discussions (students were told beforehand this would happen), and it was really great. A lot of students had their video on in the breakout rooms and it just made everything feel more energetic than in the larger setting. Even as students came back to the main room, a few would keep their video on. I randomly selected a breakout room to respond to the class. 

Used an iPad with the pencil [WHAT"S THIS CALLED?] and the Goodnotes app as the white board. This worked better for me than Zoom white board, since I often needed to write equations. I also used it write Welcome and point students to the day's notes as they entered the class. I typically started the Zoom live lecture session about 5 minutes early. 

The live lecture sessions were recorded and uploaded into the LMS, so students who were unable to attend live could still access the content.

## Exam 2

- Midterm 2: I give two in-class paper midterms during the semester where students are allowed to bring one page of handwritten notes. Given the exams would be done remotely, I opted for an open-note, open-book exam. I tried to keep the format as similar to the first exam as possible, so students typed their responses in a Word document of the exam, saved it as a PDF and uploaded their resposes to the LMS. The exam was written to be taken within 75 minutes, but students had 2 hours to take the exam to provide flexibility for any computing issues.

### Video presentations

Students had just begun their final group project [ADD LINK] before the transition, so I gave them the option to continue with the same project in their same groups or do something else. They overwhelmingly decided to stay in their same groups (I think because they had been with these groups since the 3rd week of the semester and had learned to work together). The project stayed largely the same, with the exception of the final presentation. Rather than present in-class, each group recorded a video presentation and uploaded it in a discussion thread in Sakai. I gave groups the option to upload their slides with a written transcript if video wasn't an viable option. Students were randomly assigned three presentations to write and post comments. I'll talk about this more in [SECTION NAME - THINGS TO KEEP WITH LINK], but in summary I really liked this format!

### Lessons learned


This is a blog post about going from face-to-face (f2f) to remote learning.

- Introduction. There's a [Part I to this](notion://www.notion.so/2020-05-15-thoughts-on-remote-teaching-part1.html) where I talk about how I prepared and the changes I made. In this post, I'll talk about what I want to continue doing in the fall and what I hope to change.

Part II: Lessons Learned (What I hope to keep / change in the fall)

- [What I want to continue doing](notion://www.notion.so/f2f-to-remote-part-2-b747de44787d44348b009e11d0ff373d#went_well)
- [What I want to change](notion://www.notion.so/f2f-to-remote-part-2-b747de44787d44348b009e11d0ff373d#to_change)

## What I want to continue in the fall

\label{went_well}

- What I want to continue in the fall
    - Gave survey to students [link to survey questions - google doc] to learn more about their learning circumstance. Survey inspired by a colleague who gave a similar one.
    - Flipped classroom. Have always wanted to do this but have never had the guts / time. Now I was forced to record videos and figure it out.
    - Ancedotal evidence from students that they liked this format.
    - Video presentations for the final project & discussion board. Rich conversation and enjoyed the creativity.

## What I want to change

\label{to_change}

- What I need to figure out for the fall
    - How to engage a large class on Zoom. Even with about 1/3 to half of my class being live, it is still difficult to engage that many students on Zoom. [Link to learning innovation's site on active learning]. Help foster more connection between students in the class, since they miss the time before and after class where they can causally talk with one another.
    - Give students a topic (doesn't have to be related to the content) and give them 5 minutes at the beginning of class to discuss it with each other in break out rooms. The instructor doesn't go in any of these rooms, so students can share freely with one another.
    - Help students manage teamwork remotely
    - Quality of videos on Zoom. Man they were bad. Need editing, and maybe a better way to ensure student's engage.
    - Office hours, waiting room. Use a tool like MyDigital Hand.
