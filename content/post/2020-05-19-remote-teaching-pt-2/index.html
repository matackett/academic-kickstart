This is a blog post about going from face-to-face (f2f) to remote learning. 

- Introduction. There's a [Part I to this](2020-05-15-thoughts-on-remote-teaching-part1.html) where I talk about how I prepared and the changes I made. In this post, I'll talk about what I want to continue doing in the fall and what I hope to change.

Part II: Lessons Learned (What I hope to keep / change in the fall)
- [What I want to continue doing](#went_well)
- [What I want to change](#to_change)
    
## What I want to continue in the fall
\label{went_well}

- What I want to continue in the fall

  - Gave survey to students [link to survey questions - google doc] to learn more about their learning circumstance. Survey inspired by a colleague who gave a similar one.
  - Flipped classroom. Have always wanted to do this but have never had the guts / time. Now I was forced to record videos and figure it out. 
  - Ancedotal evidence from students that they liked this format. 
  - Video presentations for the final project & discussion board. Rich conversation and enjoyed the creativity. 
  

## What I want to change
\label{to_change}

- What I need to figure out for the fall 
  - How to engage a large class on Zoom. Even with about 1/3 to half of my class being live, it is still difficult to engage that many students on Zoom. [Link to learning innovation's site on active learning]. Help foster more connection between students in the class, since they miss the time before and after class where they can causally talk with one another. 
  - Give students a topic (doesn't have to be related to the content) and give them 5 minutes at the beginning of class to discuss it with each other in break out rooms. The instructor doesn't go in any of these rooms, so students can share freely with one another.
  - Help students manage teamwork remotely
  - Quality of videos on Zoom. Man they were bad. Need editing, and maybe a better way to ensure student's engage.
  - Office hours, waiting room. Use a tool like MyDigital Hand.
