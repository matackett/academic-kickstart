<ul>
<li>Introduction. There’s a <a href="../spring-2020-pt1">Part I to this</a> where I talk about how I prepared and the changes I made. In this post, I’ll talk about what I want to continue doing in the fall and what I hope to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part II: Lessons Learned (What I hope to keep / change in the fall)
- <a href="#went_well">What I want to continue doing</a>

<ul>
<li><p>What I want to continue in the fall</p>
<ul>
<li>Gave survey to students [link to survey questions - google doc] to learn more about their learning circumstance. Survey inspired by a colleague who gave a similar one.</li>
<li>Flipped classroom. Have always wanted to do this but have never had the guts / time. Now I was forced to record videos and figure it out.</li>
<li>Ancedotal evidence from students that they liked this format.</li>
<li>Video presentations for the final project &amp; discussion board. Rich conversation and enjoyed the creativity.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>What I need to figure out for the fall
<ul>
<li>How to engage a large class on Zoom. Even with about 1/3 to half of my class being live, it is still difficult to engage that many students on Zoom. [Link to learning innovation’s site on active learning]</li>
<li>Help students manage teamwork remotely</li>
<li>Quality of videos on Zoom. Man they were bad. Need editing, and maybe a better way to ensure student’s engage.</li>
<li>Office hours, waiting room. Use a tool like MyDigital Hand.</li>
</ul></li>
